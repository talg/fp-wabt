    *-add instance pointer to wasi functions
    -add defintion of wasi struct
    uvwasi + pointer to linear memory.

    -change memory access to use wasi_struct memory pointer
    -change wasi calls to use wasi_struct wasi_state pointer

-address any XXX lines
-make sure linear memory accesses are bounded checked

-write script to make it easy to build normal code with wasi (like wasm2native).
